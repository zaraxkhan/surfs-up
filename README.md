# Surfs-Up
After wanting to open a surf shop that also sells ice cream year round in Hawaii, I find an investor, W. Avy who will help me open this shop. His main concern is the weather. In his previous investment at a surf shop, the business was rained out so he does not want to make the same mistake again. Since I have been learning to to analyize data, W. Avy asks to run some analysis on the weather data that he has saved regarding the island we will open the surf shop at. 

In this analysis, I will be using Python in VS Code and importing dependencies such as Pandas, Numpy, and SQLAlchemy with Session. 

## Overview 
After some weather analysis, W. Avy is sure about my skills, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
There are some key differences in weather in the month of June and December. I have attached a quick summary statistics for both these months below.
